# Validate your workload(s) against Azure SQL database using Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA)

DEA supports A\B testing for SQL Server upgrades, migrations to Azure SQL database and Managed Instance. However, this document will focus on Azure SQL database only, for the purpose of Ready workshop.

Database Experimentation Assistant (DEA) is an A\B testing solution for migrations to Azure SQL database. You can use DEA to capture workloads on your source SQL Server instance and replay it on Azure SQL database target to compare performance and identify compatibility issues between the two platforms. 

In this tutorial you will learn how to use DEA to:
-	 Capture the workload from your source SQL Server instance.  
-	 Replay the workload on the target Azure SQL database.  
-	 Run analysis to compare the workload between your source and target databases.  
-	 Use the analysis reports to compare performance and compatibility between source and target databases.
